## Virtual Painting

---
### Introduction
This is a mini project for learning computer vision. The learning resources are provided in https://www.computervision.zone/courses/learn-opencv-in-3-hours/.

Currently, the program can draw green, orange, and pink colors. By showing your pen to the camera, it can detect the position of the pen and its color and draw on the same position on the camera images. It can draw multiple colors at the same time.

To get a better performance, please try to keep your pens straight

You can press 'c' to clear all previous drawings, or press 'q' to exit the program.
